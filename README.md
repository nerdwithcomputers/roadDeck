# RoadDeck
---
this is the first cyberdeck I've ever built, so this should be interesting. it was essentially made because I had no computers that had a decent bit of power(I had a pinetab2, which is great if you like taking arch problems with you on the go), were decently portable(and an old thinkpad tha weighed like 20 pounds), and had a physical keyboard to code on (I LOATHE typing on virtual keyboards), so I decided to combine a keyboard that I had designed for a recent hack club ysws ([hackpad](hackpad.hackclub.com)) with a mount to hold a pi 5 with a touchscreen monitor and a battery onboard with a swiveling mount, which was far simpler than I thought it would be. I am currently waiting for the keyboard to be manufactured so I can bring it into the real world, but I figured I should create this repo in the meantime
